# ToastMasters Timer

[Live Demo → ToastMasters Timer](https://techentangle.github.io/ToastMastersTimer/)

A single-page web application that helps Toastmasters meeting timers track speeches, provide visual cues, and maintain a running log of performances.

👉 **Live Demo:** https://techentangle.github.io/ToastMastersTimer/

## Features

- **Responsive Timer Display** – Large timer that adapts to screens of any size and is paired with green/yellow/red background cues when thresholds are crossed.
- **Preset Roles** – Quick presets for Table Topics, Evaluations, and Prepared Speeches; switch to Custom to enter your own thresholds.
- **Primary Controls** – Start/Pause, Reset, End Talk, and Download CSV buttons aligned in a single toolbar for both classic and modern themes.
- **Status Progression** – Automatic evaluation of each talk as Under Time, Within Time, or Over Time, with colored pill indicators and matching icons in the log.
- **Accessible Keyboard Shortcut** – Spacebar toggles Start/Pause when focus is not on an input field.
- **Embedded Cue Sound** – Built-in audio ding (with a Test Sound button) so no external file is needed.
- **Privacy by Design** – Everything runs locally in your browser; speaker names, topics, and timing data live only in temporary memory, are never sent to a server, and vanish as soon as you refresh or close the tab.
- **Log & Export** – Each ended talk stores the speaker, topic, total time, and status; export the log as a CSV file for easy sharing or archival.
- **Modern UI Toggle** – Switch between the original look and a Bootstrap-inspired modern layout via the UI toggle bar.
- **Footer Credit** – A subtle footer credit that links to Tushar Vartak’s LinkedIn profile.

## Usage

1. Open the [hosted timer](https://techentangle.github.io/ToastMastersTimer/) or load `index.html` locally (it’s lowercase to work with GitHub Pages).
2. Enter optional speaker and topic information; the display updates live.
3. Pick a preset (or choose Custom) to control green/yellow/red thresholds.
4. Press **Start** (or hit Spacebar) to begin timing. The background changes color as thresholds are crossed.
5. Press **End Talk** when finished to log the result, reset the timer, and add the entry to the table.
6. Use **Download CSV** to export the log.

## Development Notes

- Primary functionality resides in `index.html` with inline CSS and JavaScript; there are no external dependencies.
- `ding.mp3` contains the embedded cue sound; the page converts it to base64 at load time.
- Styling includes both the legacy look and the modern Bootstrap-inspired theme; the toggle button at the top switches between them.
